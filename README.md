This is a mini project that I coded up while learning the spring animation of the react reanimated api using the native UI thread
to produce good performance and seemless animations with an infinite scroll that cycles through options.

It is well typed following strict code conventions using typescript and es-lint. It also uses alot of ES6 destructuring
syntax and relies on Expo to offer cross platform experience.

It is a very good mini project for beginners who are looking at advancing their skills to mid level. You can learn
a lot of animation configuration and syncronization. You could also borrow the mathematical ideas used to wrap circles inside the circumference of a bigger circle which are good for other projects too....
